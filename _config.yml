          Created an autonomous RC Car using Raspberry Pi 2 and arduino, Inspired by a project by Zheng Wang (https://zhengludwig.wordpress.com/projects/self-driving-rc-car/).Devised own solution for interfacing RC Car remote with arduino. Modified the python ML code to my needs.Trained the model with labelled images of the track beforehand and successfully executed many test runs of the car.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Implemented a ML Model for predicting if a file is a malware or not.It was an attempt to make an antiviruslike program which can use ML models to predict nature of a file.Downloaded and used virus database from virusshare.com and extracted features from them using feature extraction tool.Got an accuracy of about 90 Percent using KNN classification algorithm(July ’15)
